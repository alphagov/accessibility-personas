# Setting up personas

Here are instructions on how to set up various devices or browsers so you can log in as a persona.


## Chromebooks

Using [personas on Chromebooks](chromebook.html) is currently the most effective setup.


## Chrome browsers

You can also set up [personas in Chrome browsers](chrome.html) on any operating system. Some of the assistive technologies will not be as effective as on Chromebooks.
