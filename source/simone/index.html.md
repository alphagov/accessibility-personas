## Tips

When using a select-to-speak feature, you will have to stop the simulation for this to work properly: Select the Tampermonkey icon <img src="https://tampermonkey.freetls.fastly.net/images/icon.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" /> next to the address bar and click "Enabled".


## Training tasks

There are 2 versions of an example page. Version 1 shows the issues Simone experiences and version 2 shows the fixes that will help Simone. Do version 1 before version 2.

Do the following tasks logged in as Simone:

1. Read the text. Find out what you should do as a U.S. private citizen before you go abroad.
2. There are a couple of social media links under the text. Try to click on the YouTube link.
