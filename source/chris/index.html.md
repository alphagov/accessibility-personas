## About the persona

* 53 year old management accountant

* rheumatoid arthritis and colour vision deficiency (colour blindness)

* uses keyboard only, no mouse and just started using voice control

More about the [persona on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/christopher-user-with-rheumatoid-arthritis) and [how to set it up](../setup/chromebook.html#chris)


## Chromebook help

Navigate with the keyboard:

* press 'Tab' to go to the next link or form element
* press 'Shift + Tab' to go back to the previous link or form element
* press arrow keys to move between radio buttons
* press 'Space' to select radio button or checkbox
* press 'Enter' to follow a link or submit a form
* press 'Esc' to close things

If you're stuck, use the touchscreen.<br />
'Ctrl + Alt + /' shows keyboard shortcuts (only on a Chromebook).

Start voice control:

* it might already be running, say a command (see below) to find out, there should be a round microphone icon in the bottom left corner
* if it's running but 'asleep', say "wake up"
* if it's not running, click on the 'Handsfree for Web' icon <img src="https://www.handsfreeforweb.com/img/favicon-16x16.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" /> next to the address bar
* if it's unresponsive, restart the extension

Use voice control commands (only in the browser):

* say "click" and then follow the on-screen instructions, often saying a number
* say "scroll down" and "scroll up" to scroll the page
* say "help" to show a list of useful commands


## Training tasks

There are 2 versions of an example page. Version 1 shows the issues Chris experiences and version 2 shows the fixes that will help Chris. Do version 1 before version 2.

Do the following tasks logged in as Chris:

1. There is a table. Its country column includes an explanation indicated by a question mark. Try to select that question mark to find out what the explanation is.
2. The end date column might be hidden. Try to find out what the end date of the Algeria entry is.
