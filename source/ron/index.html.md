## Tips

As Ron is not very technical, do not use anything which might help. For example, do not zoom into the page and do not use the keyboard to navigate.

Because of that you might encounter issues which are not fixable. This is good for demonstrating that users have a worse experience when they don't know that there is assistive technology that would help them.


## Training tasks

There are 2 versions of an example page. Version 1 shows the issues Ron experiences and version 2 shows the fixes that will help Ron. Do version 1 before version 2.

Do the following tasks logged in as Ron:

1. Read the text. Find out the number of Cabinet ministers.
2. There is a pagination at the bottom of the text. Use it to go to the second page.

[Version 1 - issues for Ron](bad.html)

[Version 2 - fixes for Ron](good.html)
